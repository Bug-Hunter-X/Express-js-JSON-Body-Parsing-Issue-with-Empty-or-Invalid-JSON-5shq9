# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications. The problem arises when the request body is either empty or contains invalid JSON data.

## Bug Description

The Express.js server fails to parse the JSON request body when the request body is empty or contains invalid JSON. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as `req.body` being undefined or containing an empty object even when valid JSON data is expected.

## Solution

The solution involves adding error handling to gracefully handle cases where the request body is empty or contains invalid JSON.  This can involve parsing the request body manually and checking for errors, or using middleware to validate the request body before processing it. 

## How to reproduce

Clone this repository and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.  Then you can run `node bug.js` to start the server. Use a tool such as Postman or curl to send POST requests to `/data` with different payloads to observe the bug.
